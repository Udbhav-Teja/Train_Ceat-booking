The Train Seat Booking Application is a software system that utilizes Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to optimize the seat booking process for train journeys. The application aims to enhance the user experience by providing an efficient and convenient way to book train seats based on factors such as availability, preferences, and historical data.


The application offers features such as seat availability checking, seat preferences selection, optimal seat allocation based on ML algorithms and historical data, real-time updates, user profiles, and ticket generation.

To install and run the application, users can follow the provided steps, including cloning the repository, installing dependencies, setting up the database, and starting the application.

To use the application, users can launch it from the provided URL, sign up or log in, enter journey details and seat preferences, search for seat availability, select a suitable seat presented by the ML algorithm, make the payment, and generate an e-ticket.

The application employs various ML algorithms such as decision trees, random forest, gradient boosting, and reinforcement learning to optimize the seat allocation process. These algorithms analyze passenger preferences, historical data, and feedback to predict seat availability and allocate seats in an optimal manner.

Data collection includes train schedules, seat availability information, passenger preferences, and historical booking data. The collected data is processed to remove noise, handle missing values, and prepare it for ML model training.

Model training and optimization involve data preparation, model selection, evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, ensemble techniques, and reinforcement learning. The trained models are integrated into the application for optimized seat allocation.

Overall, the Train Seat Booking Application leverages ML algorithms and data analysis to provide a seamless and personalized seat booking experience for train journeys.
